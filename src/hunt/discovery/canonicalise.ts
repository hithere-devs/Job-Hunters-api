 * Collapses the same posting arriving from several sources.
 *
 * Fingerprint dedupe already catches byte-identical repeats. It does not catch
 * the common case: Greenhouse publishes a role, an aggregator republishes it
 * with a shortened description and a tracking URL, and Google indexes both. To
 * the fingerprint they are three jobs. To a person they are one, listed three
 * times, eating three slots in a list they have to read.
 *
 * Which copy survives matters more than it looks. The aggregator's URL usually
 * lands on an interstitial that the apply runtime cannot complete, while the
 * ATS copy is a form it can fill. Keeping the wrong one turns an applicable
 * job into a dead end.
